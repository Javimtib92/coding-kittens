    Hola 👋, welcome to Coding Kittens!
  </b>
</Highlight>

I'm Javier Muñoz Tous and this is my little corner. I would like to share in this blog some of the things I've been learning during this **{getYearDiffFromNow(new Date("01-05-2015"))} I've been dedicating myself to Software Development.**

Most of what you will find here is related to Javascript, Typescript and Web Development in general, but there's some room as well for some thoughts and experiments about other programming languages.

Maybe you've been wondering, "Why Coding Kittens?" <Highlight> The name of this blog is a little tribute to my two feline partners, Loki and Nym</Highlight>. Working from home, I spend a lot of time with them in my "office". That's why I always have them in my mind while I'm programming. We've all seen, sometime, a cat sleeping on top of a keyboard or passing by the camera in the middle of a meeting. That's how they are, my two hairy "co-workers" who are always keeping me company.

```typescript
const codingKittens = "Loki & Nym 🐱";
```

Thank you, Júlia 🧡 for helping me with the name and for everything else.

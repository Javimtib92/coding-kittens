    Hola 👋, welcome to Coding Kittens!
  </b>
</Highlight>

My name is Javier Muñoz Tous and you are reading my personal blog.

With over **{getYearDiffFromNow(new Date("01-05-2015"))} years of experience** in software development I've worked in all kinds of projects: `SaaS`, `Internal Tools`, `Search Engines`, `Smartphone Apps`, etc.

In this blog I will share, among other things, programming ideas, tutorials and experiences I've lived during my professional career.

Almost all the content will be about JavaScript and Web Development; but I will also include other programming languages that I may learn along the way.

```typescript
const codingKittens = "Loki & Nym 🐱";
```

  Loki and Nym are my two adorable cats and the source of inspiration for this
  blog's name.

I share office with them at home.

It's being said that in reality they are the ones typing the code and the ones who created this blog. 🤫

Thanks to Júlia, my fiance 🧡, for helping me choosing the name.

#### Some more things about me other than programming

- I live in Mallorca 🌴
- I practice Yoga twice a week 🧘‍♂️
- I'm passionate about videogames 🎮
- I love manga and anime ⛩️
- Mi favorite meal is ramen 🍜

If you want to know me a bit better you can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/javimtib92), every now and then I publish some story of my cats doing something silly.

If, on the other hand, you want to know more about my professional career you can find me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javier-muñoz-tous/) or [Github](https://github.com/Javimtib92) profiles.

I hope this little space I've built is useful to you.

Salut!
